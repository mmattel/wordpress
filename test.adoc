    # the latest tag is not recommended, because you don't know which version you'll get
    # but even if you use `owncloud/ocis:1.16.0` you cannot be sure that you'll get
    # the exact same image if you pull it at a later point in time (because docker image tags are not immutable).
    # To be 100% that you always get the same image, you can pin the digest (hash) of the
    # image. If you do a `docker pull owncloud/ocis:latest`, it also will also show you the digest.
